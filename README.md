Nspire Task Manager
===================

What is this?
-------------

This is a simple tool to show data structures of the TI-Nspires underlying operating system, Nucleus OS, for example:  
* Tasks
* Memory pools
* Event groups
* Queues
* Semaphores (classic CAS only atm)
* Mailboxes (classic CAS only atm)  

You can also delete some of them (that's why it's called "Manager" ;)

How do I compile this?
----------------------

Get the [Ndless SDK](http://ndlessly.wordpress.com/ndless-for-developers/) and type `make`.  
You might have to install a newer version of [Nspire I/O](http://nspforge.unsads.com/p/nspireio).

I want a tns file!
